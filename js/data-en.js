    greeting: ' “Stay beautiful as forever” is every women’s desire but I think the standard of beauty varies among individuals. There is a saying “Every person is different” and it applies to women’s beauty as well. You’ll be able to obtain your “true beauty” by making the best of your own characteristics. In modern society, however, there is an excess volume of information about beauty available, which makes it difficult to know what you should be following. The majority of this information focuses on imitation and outer beauty and will not help you to be yourself. For example, wearing makeup is a common part of beauty routine and it’s a nice thing to do. However, in discovering your natural beauty and accepting the way you are, you will reflect your life differently. Knowing your beauty means listening to your heart and accepting it without hesitation. Once you accomplish this, you’ll be able to relax and feel joy with sparkle that you’ve never experienced before. I’m confident that we can help you to discover and reveal your hidden natural beauty. As a body adviser and a concierge, I’ll face each customer with honesty and do my best to find your original beauty. I used to work as a Seitai therapist and have treated many customers. Even though it was over short period of time, I managed to develop my skills and experience. I’d like to use them as my strength to work as an adviser.I’m looking forward to supporting you in finding a brighter future, sharing the joy and happiness that comes when your beauty shines from your heart.'

    treatment: '・Seitai: A mixture of chiropractic and Trager approach\n・Reflexology',
    strong: 'Chiropractic treatment involves muscles, joints and lifestyles. The adjustment of muscles (Trigger point therapy) will help us to find the muscles causing you pain and will stimulate the hardened area. After that, we’ll balance your body by adjusting your backbone and pelvis, (using correcting manipulative techniques), to increase the range of motions. If you are concerned about hearing cracking sounds from moving vertebrae, we’ll use a mobilization method (slow movement). At the end of the treatment, we’ll guide you the ideal posture, breathing, walking and how to use your body. Trager approach is a bodywork technique introduced by Dr. Trager. It involves repeating gentle and comfortable motions of “weighing”, “carving” (feeling the shapes)”, “lightly stretching” and “rocking” to remind your body to move freely, smoothly and effortlessly. This treatment feels like being wrapped up softly, which helps to release tension and deeply relax both mentally and physically. We hope you’ll feel refreshed and be able to move your whole body easily after the session. We’ll provide suitable treatments to meet the individual needs. For those who like the pleasant pain of finger pressure we’ll press harder, and for those who prefer gentle massage we apply the Trager approach. Reflexology provides good stimulation on many pressure points on your feet, where nerves and capillary vessels are concentrated. Giving oil massage from your sole to the back of knees will help circulate the disrupted blood flow in your lower legs. As a result, the tension will go away from your upper body and the natural healing power will be improved. Dullness and tiredness will also be eased. Adding seitai into reflexology is also a good option. As the mind and the body are connected, you’ll feel more peaceful as your body gets lighter and set free. Let us assist you to make your days fulfilling with happiness.',
    trigger: '15 years ago, I was transferred to a new office and damaged my neck badly from working in such a busy environment. Because I was suffering from severe pain, I rushed into a chiropractic seitai clinic. After visiting them several times, I was really amazed that my neck stiffness and back pain had disappeared and my whole-body condition gradually got better. I was fascinated by chiropractors as they can help people to recover by using only their hands. I made up my mind to leave work and enter a chiropractic school. It was my first big challenge, making my own decision to start a new career.  After that, I encountered the amazing Trager approach (manipulative therapy) while I was learning reflexology at a relaxation salon. It was an eye-opening experience. Since then, I’ve been working as a therapist only.I’ve attended several Trager approach training courses and find it more interesting and enjoyable as I learnt about it in greater depth.',
    thought: 'Firstly, I make myself relaxed and try to pass my pleasant feeling on to customers through treatments. Based on verbal communication and feel, I’m able to provide different treatments for each customer according to their needs.',
    memories: 'After my treatments, many customers have given positive feedback such as saying that their core stability and posture had improved along with straightened backs. A customer who kept visiting me despite her busy work and told me that my treatment made her feel revived. A customer who asked that I come along with her for the overseas business trips to treat her.A customer who had been suffering from severely swollen ankles and had visited the hospital, where doctors couldn’t find any abnormalities. She was thankful for my treatments. She also told me that I had saved her when she was feeling overwhelmed and emotionally drained by menopausal symptoms. A customer who told me that I made her feel better both mentally and physically, so that she could spend the next day feeling energetic.A customer who had visited me for more than 11 years. When she found out that I was changing my workplace, she was brought to tears.I had to farewell to those customers and came to JYOICHI. I’ll work harder to make more customers smile from their hearts.'

    treatment: 'Trigger point treatment, cosmetic acupuncture and oil treatment',
    strong: 'Trigger point therapy uses therapeutic techniques to locate and alleviate the fundamental causes of pain. We will adjust your body to get back to normal.When you hear the word “needle”, the sharp pain of a needle may come to mind. However, in the actual treatment, what you will feel is a heavy, relaxing sensation spreading throughout your whole body. While it can be an unusual sensation to start with it often brings people back for more. It is common to feel a little apprehensive toward acupuncture for the first time, but I’ll make sure that you are comfortable and provide the suitable treatment with care. As a matter of course, I can also adjust the level of the needle stimulation according to your needs.',
    trigger: 'It all started when I was a student. I became interested in a job as a therapist after my first visit to a relaxation salon for a treatment.At that time, I was suffering from a severe headache and had to rely on painkillers several times a month. I even had nausea when my condition was at its worst. However, those symptoms were eased and my whole body felt much lighter after the first treatment.Even more amazingly, as I received regular treatments, I had less headache and nausea and didn’t have to take the painkillers as much as I used to. I still remember the feeling of the therapist’s hand who had treated me, and I also felt very comfortable being in a place of pure relaxation.',
    thought: 'We provide comfortable and effective treatments specially designed for you. In order to do so, we start with preparing appropriate treatment plans according to your bone structures, physical conditions and how you are feeling on the day.Just the weather changes from day to day, your physical condition and symptoms will not be the same each day. Providing a single method of acupuncture, body treatment, oil treatment or facial treatment may not be good enough to relieve your symptoms, so by mixing these techniques we aim to provide you the best results. We hope you will feel comfortable and relaxed while we serve you.At JYOICHI, I will do my best to help you feel the same moment of bliss I felt on my first visit to a salon.',
    memories: 'After I graduated from a professional school, I got a job at a relaxation salon. There was a customer who came to see me once a week. (I will refer her as Ms. T from now.) When I first met Ms. T, she looked quite depressed, pale, didn’t say much and avoided eye contact with me during the consultation. However, she gradually started to talk about herself while I was giving her an oil treatment. She said, “To tell you the truth, I’m mentally and physically exhausted from spending most of the day looking after my mom at home.” Ms. T opened her heart and told me that she has been having tough two years devoting herself to care for her mother. She also had no one to talk about her concerns. After the treatment, she said, “I was able to fully relax for the first time in a while. After being treated, my whole body feels lighter and I’m also talking a lot. You’ve got magical hands. I’ll use my own magical hands to care for my mom like you did to me!”. Now I’m not claiming to have magical hands, but Ms. T became a totally different person after the treatment. She looked happier and energetic and she was happy talking to me until she left.After the first treatment, she visited me once a week. She sometimes brought her mother along and they seemed to have a great relationship. I was able to gain confidence as a therapist and have found something to live for because of her. She gave me an opportunity to realize that therapists can brighten up customers’ lives. This is one of my most cherished memories.'

    strong: 'Both facial and lymph drainage treatments have the distinctive feature of providing well balanced pressure. We remove the accumulated waste products from around your face by using hands or machines, effectively slimming down your face. One of my specialties is a face lift as I can move my fingers quickly while massaging your face.\nAfter the facial treatment, we will loosen up the tight muscles on your decollete, shoulder and shoulder blades area thoroughly, so that you will feel even more refreshed after the session.\nWe aim to restore your natural skin tone and softness along with firm features.',
    trigger: 'Since I was a child, I always had an interest in fashion, makeup and being beautiful. I became a hairdresser as I wanted to work in the beauty industry. The hair salon where I was working also provided facial treatment for customers, which became the opportunity for me to start learning about it. \nDuring the same period, I met a customer whose comment led me to become a therapist. I have big and thick hands which I was not so happy about, but this customer gave me a compliment about them after I treated her face. Later, a professional therapist also said to me, “You’ve got ideal hands for a beauty therapist! We wish we had hands like yours!”./nAfter these events, my interest turned towards becoming a therapist. \nNow I like my hands and I’m proud of them. I’d like to bring out your beauty with these hands',
    memories: 'When I was working at a previous beauty salon, there was a customer who often visited us without ever designating a specific staff member to treat her. One day, I treated her by chance and she said to me, “I’ve finally met my perfect therapist!”.\nIt seemed that she had never met a therapist who could provide her treatments that she was fully satisfied with, and it was the reason she has never selected the therapist in our salon. However, my big and thick hands became her favorite, and since then she has always asked for me personally.\nWhen I told her that I was leaving the salon to start working at JYOICHI she said to me, “I’m going to miss your hands.”.\nI was able to gain confidence through knowing that my hands were able to heal customers and they in turn appreciate these hands.\nAt JYOICHI, I aim to provide comfortable and relaxing treatments for more customers.\nI like to work alongside each customer to find out what their individual needs are while providing facial and body treatments.\nPlease feel free to talk to me about anything. We may be able to find something in common as I have experienced parenting and nursing care.\nI can also provide treatments for wide range of customers from babies to seniors. '

    treatment: 'Reflexology, lymph drainage, korugi, facial, body care',
    strong: 'Oil treatment is one of my specialties. We apply oil directly on your skin and gradually massage following the flow of lymph from the fingertips to the whole body. This will be a luxurious time, as the stiffness of your body will be loosened up and relaxed, you will feel comfortable and sleepy. Oil treatment is effective for shoulder stiffness, backache and regulating autonomic function, as well as beauty and health concerns such as swelling and cellulite.Korugi is a face shaping massage method using only hands. It is effective for face lifts, swelling, fatigue recovery and face size reduction by treating bones, muscles, skeletal muscles and lymphatic nerves at the same time. The strength of the pressure can be adjusted depending on your needs.As you receive the treatment regularly the blood circulation will improve. Korugi provides great relief from societal stress with its unique stimulation and will bring you back for more. It’s worth trying! ',
    trigger: 'When I was at high school, I was asked to take care of my friend who was injured during club activities. While I used my common-sense to treat her by massaging and rubbing the affected area, I also listened to her concerns. After that, I felt so grateful to be able to help someone feel better both in mind and body. This is the reason I became a therapist. I have also studied psychology at an American university, worked at hospitals and I have done some volunteer work in the past. I would like to make use of these experiences to provide a better service.',
    thought: 'We hope coming to our salon can help you forget about your busy life and free your mind and body. We provide treatments to help you feel comfortable and gentle without worrying about unnecessary matters, so that you will have more energy for the next day.',
    memories: 'I met a customer with difficulty moving around. She visited many hospitals to find the cure but none of them could find the cause of her symptoms. She visited my salon as her last hope to receive lymph drainage and korugi. Since then, I have treated her for about eight years. She gradually reduced the number of the treatments from once a week to once a month. As she had less risk of fainting, she became able to go out by herself. From that time, I started to see her smiling every time she visited me. She also told me happily that her condition was slowly improving and there were so many things that she would like to try. Before I know it, she was more energetic than I was. I will never forget her great smile.'
